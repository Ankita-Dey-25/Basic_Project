                <dt>Regulation of the software industry</dt>
                    <dd>In 1998, Gates rejected the need for regulation of the software industry in testimony before the United States Senate.During the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) 
                    investigation of Microsoft in the 1990s, Gates was reportedly upset at then Commissioner Dennis Yao for "float[ing]
                     a line of hypothetical questions suggesting possible curbs on Microsoft's growing monopoly power". According to one source:

                    Gates was vexed. "He started by calling Yao's ideas socialistic," recalls a source familiar with the July 15 meeting,
                     "and as he got angrier and angrier and louder and louder, he got into calling them Communistic."

                  <dt>Donald Trump Facebook ban</dt>
                  <dd>On February 18, 2021, after Facebook and Twitter had banned Donald Trump from their platforms as a result of the 2020 United States presidential election which led to the
                     January 6 United States Capitol attack, Gates said a permanent ban of Trump 
                    "would be a shame" and would be an "extreme measure". He warned that it would cause
                     "polarization" if users with different political views divide up among various social networks, and said: "I don't think banning somebody who actually did get a fair number of votes (in the presidential election)
                      – well less than a majority – but I don't think having him off forever would be that good.</dd>  
                      
                    <dt>Patents for COVID-19 vaccines</dt> 
                    <dd>In April 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates was criticized for suggesting that pharmaceutical companies should hold onto patents for COVID-19 vaccines. The criticism came due to the possibility of this preventing poorer nations from obtaining adequate vaccines. Tara Van Ho of the University of Essex stated, "Gates speaks as if all the lives being lost in India are inevitable but eventually the West will help when in reality the US & UK are holding their feet on the neck of developing states by refusing to break [intellectual property rights] protections. It's disgusting."[129]

                        Gates is opposed to the TRIPS waiver.[130][131][132] Bloomberg News reported him as saying he argued that Oxford University should not give away the rights to its COVID-19 information, as it had announced, but instead sell it to a single industry partner, as it did.[133] His views on the value of legal monopolies in medicine have been linked to his views on legal monopolies in software.</dd> 

                        <dt>Cryptocurrencies</dt>
                        <dd>Gates has been critical of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. According to Gates, cryptocurrencies provide no "valuable output", contribute nothing to society, and pose a danger especially for smaller investors who could not survive the potentially high losses. Gates also does not own any cryptocurrencies himself</dd>

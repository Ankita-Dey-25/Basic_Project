          <h2>William Henry Gates</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>William Henry Gates </strong> (born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman,
               investor, philanthropist, and writer best known for co-founding the software giant Microsoft,
                along with his childhood friend Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft,
                 Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president,
                  and chief software architect, while also being its largest individual shareholder until May 2014.
                  He was a prominent pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
               Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. 
            In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gates led the company as its chairman and chief executive officer until stepping down
             as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s,
              he was criticized for his business tactics, which were considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June 2008, Gates transitioned into a part-time role at Microsoft 
              and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda had established in 2000.
               He stepped down as chairman of the Microsoft board in February 2014 and assumed the role of technology adviser to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.
               In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and development, and education.</p>
